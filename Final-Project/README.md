Here is a link to [my website!](https://claire-mayfield.github.io/)

## STEP 1: CREATING THE WEBSITE
First, I followed [these instructions](https://pages.github.com/) in order to make a website with pages.github.com, using my Github username. This involved creating a repository for my website, setting it up in desktop, creating an index.html file, and publishing it. 

## STEP 2: CREATING PAGES
- Next, within the main folder for this website, I created subfolders for each page of the website: "Bio", "Listen", "Photos", "Contact", and a folder for a secret page of my website titled "FunFacts".
- Within each of these folders, I created an index.html file, and pushed them from the Github desktop app. 
- Next, I brought the assets into each page's folder that would be used in that page. This included photos, videos, and audio files. 

## STEP 3: MAIN PAGE
### Step 3a: Getting Started
- Next, I coded the main page of my website. I started with [this code](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default). 
- This code informs the browser that the code is in HTML, contains metadata, establishes the title of the page (what you see as the title of the tab), and defines that body of the document. Then, it establishes a heading and a paragraph.
- Then, I used [this code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.ASP) to center my text.

### Step 3b: Fonts
- Next, I used [this code](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts) to establish the font for this page. I chose the font "Optima", as shown in #21 on the website.  

### Step 3c: Background Colors
- Next, I used [this code](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_color_background) to establish a background color. 
- I chose the color name using [this list](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp) of HTML colors. I chose "aliceblue".

### Step 3d: Bold and Italics 
- Next, I used [this code](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/20369-how-to-make-text-italics-in-html#google_vignette) to create italics. 
- I used [this code](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/9207-making-text-bold-in-html#:~:text=To%20make%20text%20bold%20in%20HTML%2C%20you%20can%20use%20the,the%20text%20inside%20them%20bold.) to make text bold. 

### Step 3e: Navigating to Other Pages
- Next, I used the code from [your website](https://racheldevorah.studio/) to create navigation links to the other pages on my website. 
- I used [this code](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) to create spaces between the links using "&nbsp" 

### Step 3f: Inserting and Sizing an Image
- Next, I used [this code](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_images_attributes) to insert an image. Then, I adjusted the width and height, measured in pixels. I kept the same proportions as the original 7 by 5 image, making it 700 by 500 pixels.

### Step 3g: Inserting an Audio File
- Next, I used the code from [your Github example website](https://rdwrome.github.io/) to insert an audio file. 

## STEP 4: BIO PAGE
- I used the same code from step 3c to set the background color for this page. 
- Then, I used the same code from step 3b to set the font.
- Then, I used the same code from step 3a to center my text.
