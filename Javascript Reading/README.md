# Javascript Reading

# Chapter 1: 
One thing I am already familiar with is strings, and that they represent text. I know that they must be within quotation marks in order to work, and they can be in either a single or a double quote. I did not know that they could also be within back ticks. I also didn't know that the word "null" can generally be used interchangeablly with an undefined value. 

# Chapter 2: 
I am already a little familiar with bindings, and the concept of assigning information to a variable. In prior programming experience, I have assigned a numeric value to x in a program so that the program can solve an equation, knowing what the value of x is. I didn't know it was possible to add "comments," which is text meant for people to read that will be ignored by the program. This text can explain your code to help people be able to understand it. 

# Chapter 3: 
In math, I am familiar with the concept of functions. In school, I learned about a function as something being put in, going through the rules of the function, and something being put out. I have used this concept in math, but I haven't used it in programming yet. I didn't know that Javascript is flexible with the number of arguments you pass to a function. You can define a function with just one parameter, and when you call for more than that, your program will still work. This works because the program ignores the other arguments and goes with the first one that you listed.
