# Final Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Claire Mayfield's Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. 

I would like to make a portfolio website that showcases my accomplishments, compositions, and resume. 

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

1. The materials on the class Github. 
2. https://html.com/ 
3. https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like to have a main page for my website with various additional pages such as a bio page, a photos page, and a contact me page. In my bio, I will include a few paragraphs about my musical background and accomplishments. In my photos page, I will upload 5-10 photos from performances, recording sessions, and other music related activities. In my contact me page, I will have links to all of my social medias. If I have extra time, I could create a text box for the user to send me a message directly from my website. 

I will be programming my website using HTML. 

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

I will be putting recordings of projects from my video game scoring classes onto this website, such as my work in GAIM-371: Scoring for Interactive Media. My professor for this class is Gina Zdanowicz.  

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have a few different pages that can be clicked on, with an option to go back to the main page. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would also include audio recordings and videos. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would also include a sophisticated design that is aesthetically pleasing, with touches like making buttons animate when clicked, or assigning sounds to certain actions. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

First, I need to learn HTML, which I can learn both in and outside of class. Next, I would like to draw a plan for what I want my website to look like. Then, I would like to create the different pages and make it possible to go from the main page to a sub page. Then, I will upload my audio files and my pictures.
