I started by copying the following code from our code-along from class:

`for (let i = 1500; i <= 2700; i++) {
  if (i % 7 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
    }
  }`
  
 Then, I changed the numbers to match this assignment:
  
  `for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log(i);
      }
    }` 

This code didn't quite work because it simply printed out all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
