# Python Reading

## Chapter 1: The Way of the Program
- **One thing I knew:** I'm already familiar with the program instructing a language to display the words "Hello, World!" from what we did in our first classes of this semester.
- **One thing I didn't know:** I didn't know that there were multiple versions of Python. It's also good to know that it's easy to switch between the different versions because they are very similar.  
## Chapter 3: Functions
- **One thing I knew:** I'm already familiar with the concept of a function, and that first you name and define it, and then you can call it by the name you assigned to it. 
- **One thing I didn't know:** I didn't know that one function can call another function, which can call another function, and so on. Because of this, reading a program won't always be linear. 
## Chapter 5: Conditionals and Recursion
- **One thing I knew:** I'm already familiar with the modulus operator, which tells you the remainder that results from dividing two numbers. We used this concept in our FizzBuzz assignment, and using the knowledge that if the remainder of a division is 0, then those numbers are divisable by each other.
